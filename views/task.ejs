                    You are working for a large financial institution. You are apart team of customer service
                    representatives that deal with sensitive customer information and have several hundred people
                    calling each day requesting this information. Your manager decided to try out AFD and has had it in
                    operation over the last month.


                </p>

                <p>
                    You receive a call from a man claiming to be someone by the name of Matt Damon. The phone number
                    matches what is on record, but the man on the phone claims to not remember to remember the answer on
                    his security question. The audio recording of everything the person has said is recorded by your
                    system and is available for replay or download below.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In the next five minutes, listen to the audio, and use the dashboard and audio upload system to
                    decide if you would release protected information to the person on the phone. Once you have decided, you can
                    indicate below your answer.
